Java Kalman Filter

i<p>

The Kalman Filter was originally designed to represents information about a moving objects. Moving objects
are modeled using a discrete time dynamic system. An object has spatio-temporal state x t . The spatio-
temporal state is represented by location [x, y, t] and velocity [d x , d y ]. Here [x, y] is referred to as 2D position
[x, y] of the object at the time t.
Data is supposed to be uncertain â€“ noisy, some states might be missing and other are biased. At the
moment, the object state x t is characterized by a state vector x, containing position and velocity vector [x, y, d x , d y ]. In that way, the trajectory is constructed (in 2D). However it cannot be observed directly, because it is
encumbered by hidden (Gaussian) noise w. The system produces visible output vector y that is a simple linear
observation (x evolves first-order Markov process), encumbered by noise v.
