RngPack is a pseudorandom number generator package for Java. Pseudorandom means that the "random" numbers are generated by a deterministic mathematical process, not by a fundamentally random physical process such as radioactive decay or Johnson noise. RngPack contains base classes that add value to random number generators, four research grade generators, as well as a wrapper for Java's built in random number generator and a demonstration application.
