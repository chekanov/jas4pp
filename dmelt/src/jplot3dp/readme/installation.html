<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>This program needs Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.4.2 or above installed in your system to run properly.
<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>Doesn't actually require an installation. Double clicking the uvodeller.jar will start the program in most systems. However, in some systems, if the associations are not made correctly, you may need to create a script (.bat, .sh, etc) to start it. The command that you should use to run is "java -jar uvodeller.jar".
