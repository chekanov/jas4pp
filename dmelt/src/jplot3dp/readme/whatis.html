<p>This program lets you plot and explore 3 Dimensional Graphs of Mathematical Functions.</p>
<p>For more information visit my website at <a href="http://geocities.com/hirak_99/java/uvmodeller.html">geocities.com/hirak_99/java/uvmodeller.html</a>. If you are reading this from within the program, I would recommend you to open the link in your system's browser.
<br>You can also send your congratulation/suggestion/criticism mails at <a href="mailto:hirak_99@myrealbox.com?subject=Find Duplicates">hirak_99@myrealbox.com</a>.
<p>I hereby declare this as a freeware! Enjoy!
<p>Note: I enjoy feedback.
<p>Regards,

<p>If you are using the program, you are running the risk of inadvertantly starting a chain of events which might ultimately cause the destruction of our Universe. If any thing like that (or less serious than that) happens, I will not be held responsible.</p>
<p>Hmm... I tried to put up something similar to the legal jargon accompanying most programs... Seems like I exaggerated slightly.</p>
