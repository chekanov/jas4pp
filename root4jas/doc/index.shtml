<h2>
<a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
The <a href="http://java.freehep.org/lib/freehep/api/hep/io/root/package-summary.html">hep.io.root
package</a> contains a simple Java interface for reading Root files. The
package is not designed to duplicate the functionality of Root, just to
allow the data in root files to be read from Java. The package is valuable
for data-centric classes, for which access to the data without the associated
C++ classes is useful. Examples include viewing Root histograms from Java,
accessing Root data from Java based event displays, and using Root files
from Java based data analysis tools. Another potential use of the package
is to access Root files from Java based scripting languages such as <a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a>,
<a href="http://www.beanshell.org/">Beanshell</a>
or <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/koala/djava/">DynamicJava</a>.
<p>The package allows Java to read any Root file, including files containing
user defined objects, by exploiting the <a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/SchemaEvolution.html">StreamerInfo</a>
objects embedded in Root files. If you use the default Root streamer mechanism
then the StreamerInfo objects are created by Root automatically. (If you
write your own object streamer for Root then you must also provide a StreamerInfo
object for your class, or the Java interface will not be able to read it).
Since the StreamerInfo objects were extensively redesigned for Root 3.0,
the current Java IO package can only read files created with Root 3.00/6
or later.
<h2>
<a NAME="Reporting Bugs"></a>Reporting Bugs</h2>
The Root IO format is quite complex, and there is little documentation
on the internal format, so getting everything to work correctly takes quite
a bit of trial and error. Since this is an early release it is quite likely
that the package may have problems reading your particular Root files.
If this happens please e-mail me, <a href="mailto:tonyj@slac.stanford.edu">tonyj@slac.stanford.edu</a>,
and if at all possible make your Root file available so that I can debug
the problem. Once we have enough different Root files for testing the package
should ultimately become very reliable.
<h2>
<a NAME="Performance"></a>Performance</h2>
In the interests of getting something available as quickly as possible,
very little effort has been made to make the current release efficient.
In particular in future releases of the hep.io.root package we will dynamically
create root classes, and believe this will give several orders of magnitude
gain in performance. See the <a href="implementation.htm">implementation
notes</a> for more details.
<h2>
<a NAME="Demos"></a>Demos</h2>
Several <a href="http://java.freehep.org/demo/Root/">demos</a> of the hep.io.root
package are <a href="http://java.freehep.org/demo/Root/">available</a>.
<h2>
<a NAME="Download"></a>Download</h2>
To use the Java package you only need to download a single file, <a href="http://jas.freehep.org/plugins/root/0.2.0/root.jar">root.jar</a>
(you may need to right-click and select <i>Save As</i> to prevent your
browser trying to run the jar file instead when you click on the link).
This file contains:
<ul>
<li>
The basic root IO (hep.io.root) package</li>

<li>
A Root Object Browser, demo/debug application</li>

<li>
A Java "interface builder" for dynamically creating Java Interfaces for
user defined objects in the file</li>

<li>
A Data Interface Module (DIM) for Java Analysis Studio (JAS)</li>
</ul>
You can also build the root IO package yourself by downloading the source
code, which is distributed as part of the <a href="http://java.freehep.org">FreeHEP
Java Library</a>.
<h2>
<a NAME="Root Object Browser"></a>Root Object Browser</h2>
As an illustration of the use of the Java interface, we have built a sample
application which is a simple Root Object Browser. It can be used to open
any Root file and look at all the objects inside the file. If you already
have Java 2 installed (JDK 1.3), you can <a href="#Download">download</a>
the root.jar file containing the application, and run it using the command:
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<pre>java -jar root.jar</pre>
</blockquote>
(on Windows you can just double-click on the root.jar file). A screen shot
of the application is show below.&nbsp; The pane on the left shows the
directory structure of the file. The object browser knows how to navigate
directories (TDirectories), trees (TTrees and TBranches) and these will
all be shown in the left pane. Clicking on any object in the left pane
will cause the details of the object to be shown in the right pane. The
right pane knows how to follow embedded pointers to other objects.
<p><img SRC="RootObjectBrowser.gif" BORDER=0 height=384 width=574>
<p>It is a good idea to try out the Object Browser on any root file you
are interested in using, before trying any of the examples below. If the
Object Browser is not able to display your file correctly, then you have
probably discovered a bug in the Java package, and should <a href="#Reporting Bugs">report
it</a>. It is unlikely any of the following example programs will work
if the object browser does not work.

Before running any of these examples make sure you have root.jar in your
CLASSPATH, by typing something like:
<pre>set CLASSPATH=.;root.jar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (windows)</pre>

<pre>setenv CLASSPATH .:root.jar (unix, csh)</pre>

<h3>
Opening a Root file and Accessing a Histogram.</h3>
This example requires the file Example.root file, which you can down load
<a href="ftp://ftp.slac.stanford.edu/software/jas/RootData/Example.root">here</a>.
<p>Root files can contain many objects, each referenced by a key (TKey).
To access a particular object you must know its key. You can use the RootObjectBrowser
described above to browse the contents of a file and discover what keys
are contained in it. In this example we access the Histogram whose key
is "mainHistogram":
<p><!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan --><servlet code="ColorizeServlet"><param name="source" value="examples/RootTest.java"></servlet><!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" endspan -->
<p>To compile and run this example just issue the commands:
<pre>javac RootTest.java
java RootTest</pre>
A <a href="RootWithJAS.shtml">more interesting example</a> which actually
displays histograms is also available.
<h3>
Reading User Defined Objects</h3>
This example requires that your have the file Moy.root file, which you
can download <a href="ftp://ftp.slac.stanford.edu/software/jas/RootData/Moy.root">here</a>.
<p>Before reading the file you must first use the Interface Builder to
create the Java Interface for the user-defined objects contained in your
file. To do
this run the following command:
<pre>java hep.io.root.util.InterfaceBuilder Moy.root</pre>
This should create a file hep/io/root/interfaces/Moyennes.java. (The sub-directories
follow Java's normal convention of putting source files into subdirectories
corresponding to the package). If you look inside the file created you
will see that it looks like this:
<p><!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan --><servlet code="ColorizeServlet"><param name="source" value="examples/Moyennes.java"></servlet><!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" endspan -->
<p>As you can see that the InterfaceBuilder has created an interface with
accessor methods for each data member inside the user defined object (Moyennes
in this case). Using this interface it is now easy to write a routine to
access the objects from the file:
<p><!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan --><servlet code="ColorizeServlet"><param name="source" value="examples/MoyTest.java"></servlet><!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" endspan -->
<p>You can compile and run this routine by typing:
<pre>javac MoyTest.java
java MoyTest</pre>

<h3>
Reading Files Containing TTrees.</h3>
The following example shows how to read user-defined objects contained
in a Root TTree. This example uses the file Event.root created by <a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/examples/Event.C.html">this
Root example</a>. (You can download this file <a href="ftp://ftp.slac.stanford.edu/software/jas/RootData/Event.root">here</a>,
but it is 17MB, so maybe you should recreate it yourself using Root).
<p>As before the first step is to create the Java Interfaces corresponding
to the user defined objects. You do this by issuing the command:
<pre>java hep.io.root.util.InterfaceBuilder Event.root</pre>
Now you can compile and run the following program:
<p><!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan --><servlet code="ColorizeServlet"><param name="source" value="examples/EventTest.java"></servlet><!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" endspan -->
<p>If you compare this program to the <a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/examples/eventa.cxx.html">equivalent
Root script</a>, you will see that in the Java example it is not necessary
to say in advance which branches of the tree should be read. This is because
the hep.io.root package returns "Hollow Objects"&nbsp; for Event and Track,
and the data is only fetched from the file as needed by calls to accessor
methods (e.g. getXXX()) on these objects. This means Java gains the efficiency
of only reading the required branches without the user having to explicitly
list the branches. (The efficiency gains made possible are not fully realized
in the current implementation, due to the early nature of this release,
but in subsequent releases we expect the speed of this demo to increase
dramatically).
