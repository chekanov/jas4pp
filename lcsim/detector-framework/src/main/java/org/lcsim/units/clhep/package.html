<p>
The org.lcsim.units.clhep package is a straightforward port of the
header files in the Units include directory of CLHEP 2.0.3.0, written
by @author Jeremy McCormick (SLAC). This  is the system of units 
used by Geant4 and also the GDML/LCDD geometry processors.  The compact
detector description can also use these units.
<p>

<p>
The @see SystemOfUnits class defines the CLHEP numerical system of
units, including length and energy.
</p>

<p>
The @see PhysicalConstants class defines commonly used physical
constants, such as Avogadro's number, the speed of light, and
the classical electron radius, among others.
