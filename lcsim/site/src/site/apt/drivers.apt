Drivers  

    One of the most fundamental concepts in LCSim is the Driver, which is an algorithm that runs on event data.
    Drivers may have child Drivers, so the entire algorithm structure is hierarchical.

    The {{{apidocs/org/lcsim/util/Driver.html}Driver API documentation}} shows all the classes that derive from
    this class under the "Direct Known Subclasses" section.  These may all be called from within LCSim steering
    files.
