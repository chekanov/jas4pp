        Jas 3 versions follow 3.A.B format,
        where A and B correspond to major and minor version numbers.
      </p><p>
        The major version number is incremented when some essential new functionality is added, 
        or when Jas 3 behavior is changed in a significant and possibly incompatible way.
        Minor version numbers usually designate maintenance releases - bug fixes and minor improvements.
      </p><p>
        Built-in plugins are a part of the Jas 3 core distribution and have the same version number.
        Extensions and user-written plugins follow their own versioning schemes.
      </p><p>
        Before the 3.0.0 release, Jas 3 beta releases followed 0.A.B format.
