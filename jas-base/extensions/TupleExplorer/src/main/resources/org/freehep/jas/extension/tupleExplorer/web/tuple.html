<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The JAS Tuple Explorer is a tool for creating plots from tabular data (or N-tuples). 
It is particularly well suited to statistical analysis of large tables (with 
1,000s or 1,000,000s of rows). The main features are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Many Data Formats Supported
  <ul>
    <li>SQL database </li>
    <li>ASCII text files </li>
    <li>PAW files </li>
    <li>Root files </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Support for very large N-tuples (larger than will fit in memory) </li>
  <li>Columns may be int, float, double, boolean, String, Date, Object
  <ul>
    <li>Allows new columns to be defined on the fly </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Built-in expression compiler/evaluator </li>
  <li>1D, 2D histograms, profile plots, scatterplots, lego plots, surface plots, 
  color plots. </li>
  <li>Multiple overlays on same plot </li>
  <li>Dynamic cuts - based on expressions or sliders </li>
  <li>Tabulation of data </li>
  <li>Plots and Cuts can be arranged on page
  <ul>
    <li>Drag and drop for easy page building </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Entire status of interface saved in human-readable/editable XML format
  </li>
  <li>System is modular and extensible, easy to add:
  <ul>
    <li>New data formats </li>
    <li>New cut types </li>
    <li>New plot types </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Text in <span class="limitation">green</span> indicates limitations which 
will be removed soon in future releases.</p>
<h3>Open and Closing Data Sets</h3>
<p>To open a dataset you can either use <i>File</i>, <i>Open File</i> menu item. 
You can currently open text files, SQL databases (using JDBC) as well as Paw 
files and Root files (written with Root 3.00/6 or later).
<span class="limitation">Currently all NTuples are read in to memory when they 
are opened, so for large data sources this may take some time (and even worse 
you may run out of memory.)</span> </p>
<p>Once you have opened a file any NTuples found in the file will be displayed 
in the tree on the right of the window. To close an NTuple select it in the tree 
and use the <i>File</i>, <i>Close</i> menu.</p>
<h3>Creating a Plot</h3>
<p>The easiest way to create a plot is to double-click on the column to be 
plotted in the tree. This will create a Histogram of the column selected. 
Alternatively you can choose two columns and use the <i>Histogram</i>, <i>
Scatter Plot</i> or <i>Profile Plot</i> commands in the Tuple menu. When 
selecting two or more columns the order of the selection is important, for 
example when creating 2D plots it determines which items will appear on the X 
and Y axes. <span class="limitation">In future we will have a Create Plot 
command which will allow much more flexibility in creating plots.</span></p>
<p>You can make many changes to the style and limits of the plot using the popup 
menu available by right-clicking on the plot. You can also perform fits using 
this menu.</p>
<h3>Defining New Columns</h3>
<p>You can define new columns dynamically which are derived from the information 
in the existing columns. Select an N-Tuple in the tree, and then choose <i>Tuple</i>,
<i>Define New Column</i>. </p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/defaul1.jpg" border="0" width="442" height="126"></p>
<p>Enter the name for the new column in the top text field, and enter the 
expression to evaluate in the lower text field. The expression can use the names 
of other columns directly, and any of the common math functions (for a complete 
list see the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html">
java.lang.Math</a> class). For example if your N-Tuple contains columns X and Y 
you can define a new column using the expression:</p>
<p align="center">sqrt(X*X+Y*Y)</p>
<p align="left">Note that items in the expression are case sensitive. 
Right-clicking in the expression field will bring up a popup menu that&nbsp; you can 
use to easily insert references to columns. The expressions use normal Java 
syntax (which in basically the same as C syntax).</p>
<p align="left">For columns that contain Strings or Dates you can use methods 
from the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/lang/String.html">
java.lang.String</a> class and
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/lang/Date.html">
java.lang.Date</a> class. For example:</p>
<p align="center">Nation.toLowerCase()</p>
<h3>Creating cuts</h3>
<p>Cuts allow you to reject some columns of the N-tuple from your plots. To 
create a new cut select an N-Tuple in the tree, the choose <i>Tuple</i>, <i>Add 
Cut</i>.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/defaul2.jpg" border="0" width="401" height="251"></p>
<p>Currently there are two types of cuts you can create, a numeric cut or a 
general cut. Numeric cuts can only be applied to numeric columns. They allow you 
to use sliders to rapidly change the cut thresholds and see how this effects you 
plots. General cuts allow you to use boolean expressions to accept or reject 
columns. Unlike numeric cuts they can be applied to multiple columns and can 
work on non-numeric columns. After creating a cut it will appear as a new column 
in your N-Tuple. Double-click on the column to change the cut, or to change the 
sliders. </p>
<p><span class="limitation">More cut types will be added later. </span></p>
<h3>Cut Sets</h3>
<p>By default all cuts are applied to all plots. This can be adjusted by using 
Cut Sets. By default a single Cut Set is created for each N-Tuple, called the <i>
Default Cut Set</i>. All cuts are added to the default cut set as they are 
created. The default cut set is applied to all new plots as they are created.</p>
<p>You can view the contents of the default cut set by selecting an N-Tuple in 
the tree, and then selecting <i>Tuple</i>, <i>Show Default Cut Set</i>. </p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/defaul3.jpg" border="0" width="467" height="278"></p>
<p align="left">Using this dialog you can add and remove cuts from the default 
cut set, and can also invert or disable individual cuts. </p>
<p align="left">You can create any number of Cut Sets using the <i>Tuple</i>, <i>
Add Cut</i> command, and can add and remove cuts from them by double-clicking on 
the column representing the Cut Set in the tree. Cut sets can be nested inside 
other cut sets. <span class="limitation">The Add and Remove buttons in the Add 
Cut Dialog, Cut Set tab do not currently work. You must create the cut, then 
double click on it to bring up its properties dialog, and add and remove items 
from that dialog.</span></p>
<p align="left">You can change the cuts which are applied to a particular plot 
by right clicking on the plot, and choose <i>Cuts</i> from the popup menu. Each 
plot has its own (anonymous) cut set, which by default contains the Default Cut 
Set. You can remove the Default Cut Set and add or remove any other cuts you 
want (note however that making changes to the Default Cut Set itself will effect 
all plots to which it is applied).</p>
<h3>Tabulating Data</h3>
<p>You can tabulate a complete N-Tuple by selecting the N-Tuple in the tree and 
choosing <i>Tuple</i>, <i>Tabulate</i>. You can tabulate selected columns of the 
N-Tuple by selecting those columns and choosing <i>Tuple</i>, <i>Tabulate 
Selected Columns</i>. The columns will be placed in the table in the order in 
which they were selected. You can change the order by dragging on the column 
headers.</p>
<h3>Working with Pages</h3>
<p>You can create any number of pages using the <i>File</i>, <i>New, Plot Page</i> 
command. You can &quot;drag &amp; drop&quot; columns of the NTuple into the page to create 
plots. If you drop multiple columns onto the same plot they will be overlaid on 
the same plot. You can also drag cuts on to the page. <span class="limitation">
&nbsp;It is not currently possible to drag 2D plots on to the page. </span>You can 
move items around on the page by clicking on them, and then dragging on the blue 
border. </p>
<p>You can print pages using the <i>Print</i> (or <i>Print Preview</i>) commands 
in the <i>File</i> menu. <span class="limitation">In future more flexibility 
over the size and style of pages will be provided.</span></p>
